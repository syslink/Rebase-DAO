Initial design ideasï¼š
1. The Community Committee allocates three types of NFT according to the contribution of community members: Gold NFT, Silver NFT and Bronze NFT, users who get these NFT which we call RightNFT, they have the right to mint the Three Kingdoms Heroes cards.
2. Users assigned to RightNFT can go to mint the Three Kingdoms Heroes NFT (HeroNFT), different type of RightNFT can mint different ranking HeroNFT, such as Gold RightNFT can mint the ranking 1 ~ 10 HeroNFT, when HeroNFT is minted, RightNFT will be destroyed. In addition, RightNFT with time attributes, beyond the time the RightNFT will be invalid.
2. When the community needs to be governed, the user holding HeroNFT can participate in the vote, the higher the ranking of the character, the greater the voting weight, each HeroNFT can only vote a maximum of three times!
3. HeroNFT could be traded on the public NFT market. This will motivate members to contribute more to the community.
